#Create a query for real-time visualization
#To send streaming data to Power BI, your Azure Stream Analytics job uses a query that writes its results to a Power BI output.
#A simple query that forwards event data from an event hub directly to Power BI might look something like this:
SELECT
    EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS ReadingTime,
    SensorID,
    ReadingValue
INTO
    [powerbi-output]
FROM
    [eventhub-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
    
#Alternatively, you might use your query to filter and/or aggregate the data, sending only relevant or summarized data to the Power BI dataset
#For example, the following query calculates the maximum reading for each sensor other than sensor 0 for each consecutive minute in which an event occurs.
SELECT
    DateAdd(second, -60, System.TimeStamp) AS StartTime,
    System.TimeStamp AS EndTime,
    SensorID,
    MAX(ReadingValue) AS MaxReading
INTO
    [powerbi-output]
FROM
    [eventhub-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime
WHERE SensorID <> 0
GROUP BY SensorID, TumblingWindow(second, 60)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
